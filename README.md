# A-regression-analysis-of-airline-costs.

A group project of the Applied Biostatistics course at EPFL. In this project we performed the EDA of the input data to explore how typical airline parameters like length of flight or population served influence the operational costs. Finally we create a linear regression model to predict the operational costs based on input features.

The whole analysis is written in R.
